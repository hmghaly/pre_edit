The Secretary-General's special representatives and envoys worked with conflict parties to achieve ceasefires and political settlements. In Yemen, a United Nations-brokered truce delivered tangible benefits to the Yemeni people and enabled the parties to discuss the de-escalation of hostilities. In Libya, we supported inclusive consultations with stakeholders on overcoming the protracted political impasse and holding national elections. In Lebanon, our peacekeeping mission supported stability, including with support to a regular tripartite forum. In Abyei, we assisted efforts to improve intercommunal relations. The United Nations mission in Colombia expanded its peacebuilding support as requested by the new Government and accompanied the resumed peace talks between the Government and the National Liberation Army.

The United Nations also continued to work with all concerned to mitigate the global impacts of the crisis. To ease global impacts on food and fertilizers, we actively engaged in negotiating and facilitating implementation of the Black Sea Grain Initiative, which was signed by TÃ¼rkiye, the Russian Federation and Ukraine in July 2022. We also signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Russian Federation to facilitate the transparent unimpeded access of food and fertilizers, including the raw materials required to produce fertilizers. As the war continues unabated, the United Nations will maintain efforts toward preventing further escalation and promoting a just and sustainable peace, in line with the United Nations <span id="HYPG" class="replacement automatic delete tentative" name="Nations Charter _, | Nations _,"><span class="from_repl from_initial">Charter</span> <span class="to_repl to_initial"></span></span> , international law, and relevant General Assembly resolutions.</td></tr><tr class="table-light" name="word/document.xml|cc6c51e464"><td>Our partnerships with regional organizations remained essential.
