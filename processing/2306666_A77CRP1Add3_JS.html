The challenges that we face can only be addressed through stronger international cooperation. The Summit of the Future in 2024 is an opportunity to agree on multilateral solutions for a better tomorrow, by strengthening global governance for both present and future generations (General Assembly resolution 76/307). In my capacity as Secretary-General, I have been invited to provide inputs to the preparations for the Summit in the form of action-oriented recommendations, building on the proposals contained in my report entitled “Our Common Agenda” (A/75/982), which was itself a response to the declaration on the commemoration of the seventy-fifth anniversary of the United Nations (General Assembly resolution 75/1). The present policy brief is one such input. It elaborates on the ideas first proposed in Our Common Agenda, taking into account subsequent guidance from Member States and over one year of intergovernmental and multi-stakeholder consultations <span id="ANPG" class="replacement automatic delete tentative" name="consultations, and | consultations and"><span class="from_repl from_initial">,</span> <span class="to_repl to_initial"></span></span> and rooted in the purposes and the principles of the Charter of the United Nations, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other international instruments.</td></tr><tr class="table-light" name="word/document.xml|bba22fd60c"><td>Purpose of this policy brief</td></tr><tr class="table-dark text-dark" name="word/document.xml|3674d379cd"><td>The 2030 Agenda <span id="YTH9" class="replacement automatic delete tentative" name="Agenda for Sustainable Development and | Agenda and"><span class="from_repl from_initial">for Sustainable Development</span> <span class="to_repl to_initial"></span></span> and Our Common Agenda recognize a harmful anachronism at the heart of global policymaking, that our economic models and measurements overlook many aspects that sustain life and contribute to human well-being, while perversely placing disproportionate value on activities that deplete the planet. The intention of the proposals presented in this policy brief is not to replace Gross Domestic Product (GDP <span id="2SIX" class="replacement automatic delete tentative" name="GDP), | GDP,"><span class="from_repl from_initial">)</span> <span class="to_repl to_initial"></span></span> , but to outline a path to complementary metrics to GDP that more completely focus on what matters to people, the planet, and the future.</td></tr><tr class="table-light" name="word/document.xml|6ef2f7eb41"><td>Today, the world is facing catastrophic and interconnected crises – including climate change, deteriorating ecosystems and biodiversity loss, devastating conflicts <span id="MHY4" class="replacement automatic delete tentative" name="conflicts, and | conflicts and"><span class="from_repl from_initial">,</span> <span class="to_repl to_initial"></span></span> and violence, increasing poverty, hunger, inequalities, unsustainable debt burdens, and heightened costs of living – which show no sign of abating. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are badly off-track. GDP has become a proxy for how we determine value, how we measure wealth creation and development progress <span id="7M5Y" class="replacement automatic delete tentative" name="progress, and | progress and"><span class="from_repl from_initial">,</span> <span class="to_repl to_initial"></span></span> and how we allocate resources on that basis.</td></tr><tr class="table-dark text-dark" name="word/document.xml|a2678cc008"><td>As mentioned in my Our Common Agenda report, GDP does not account for human well-being, environmental sustainability, unpaid household services, such as the care economy <span id="DBC5" class="replacement automatic delete tentative" name="economy, and | economy and"><span class="from_repl from_initial">,</span> <span class="to_repl to_initial"></span></span> and the unequal impact of economic activity. Moreover, it fails to capture the human and environmental destruction of some economic activities. Harmful practices, such as deforestation, overfishing, the burning of fossil fuels and other destruction of nature, often count as an increase in GDP.

We need a paradigm shift in what we measure as progress so that we can capture data on the activities and outcomes that a society truly values – and then use them to better inform our policy and financial decisions. We have an opportunity to shape our future into one that is more equal and resilient to crises, and where the benefits of social and economic progress are shared by all.
